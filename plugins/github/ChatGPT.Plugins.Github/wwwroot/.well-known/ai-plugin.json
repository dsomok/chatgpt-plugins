It accepts the link to the repository from the user. The first step is to analyze the structure of the repository. The response is the list of all files that are present in the repository. After receiving the list of files the most relevant files should be queried iteratively. Before giving an answer to the user, the relevance of the answer should be calculated, if it less than 0.7, then additional files should be requested. The process should be repeated until the relevance score is higher than 0.7. If error occures when querying file contents, inform the user that an error ocurred and you are not able to generate the response.",
